# vs2015BuildOnSave
A Visual Studio 2015 extension to build containing project after saving a file

Visual Studio 2015 has the roslyn compiler, but from what I can gather, that's only compatible with .NET 5 projects.  Asp.NET 5, at the time of creating this repository, is still in pre-release mode.

Redgates .NET Demon used to perform this task for us, but they've since stopped supporting VS2015.  

This project was quickly thrown together just to have something useable.
